Hi, I am Raj and I am signing up for subtitling in Hindi at Rev. Let's talk about my favourite movie now.  

It is a science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.

It is about a specialized police department called "Precrime" operating in North Virginia and Washington,D.C. areas of USA which apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by three psychics whom they called "precogs".

Precogs had a special gift since the birth because of which they were able to see stuff in their dreams that others cannot. The film combines elements of thriller and science fiction genres, as well as it is traditional chase film as the main protagonist Jon Anderton who is the Precrimes Chief is himself accused of the future murder and becomes a fugitive.

Tom Cruise did a very great job playing his character John Anderton and because of which it become one of his best movies. John Anderton rescues Agatha who is the main Precog and also the most gifted one, from the Police Department because he wanted to prove himself as innocent by proving that a Precog have made a false prediction about him commiting a crime.

In movie, "Minority Report" is a term used to describe a scenario when the Agatha  , the female precog sees a different vision than the other 2 Precogs.  

At the end, the person who murdered the mother of Agatha and also who framed John as murderer was exposed by John in a ceremony organized to award him and he had no other choices but to commit suicide by shooting himself.
