ATM-Simulator-System

I recently created an ATM Simulator System using Java Swing(for UI) and JDBC technology(for Database connectivity) in Java. It was a fun experience. 

It can be used as software in an ATM and has the potential to provide many different services to user such as creating Bank A/C, Deposits, Withdrawals, Fast Cash, Mini statements, Balance Enquiry, PIN change, etc. It offers a user-friendly UI and seamless interaction with the user. 

When a user tries to access the ATM system, they will be prompted to enter their card number and PIN. The system will then validate the entered information against the database using JDBC. If the information is correct, the user is granted access; otherwise, an error message is displayed. If the user doesn't have an account, he can sign up and create one. After account creation, the user will need to deposit some amount so that he can use the various services offered like Withdrawal, FastCash, Mini Statement, Balance Enquiry, etc.  

All the details are stored in the MYSQL database which I have created on my Local system. You can create the same database running a list of MySQL queries on your system which I have provided on GitHub in DB_commands.txt.
